# This Repsoitory
This is an image viewer I built to gain a greater understanding of C++ it is built using [Walnut](https://github.com/StudioCherno/Walnut) which is an application framework around [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). Currently only support for the [PNG](https://www.w3.org/TR/png-3/#) specification is supported but support for JPEG and other common formats is planned.

## Build
Run the `setup.bat` file in the scripts folder and a VS22 sln file will be created for the project that can be ran.
